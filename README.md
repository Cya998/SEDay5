Helps one choose the depth of explanation as experts prefer in-depth technical details and complex workflows whereas general users need simplified, step-by-step guidance.

Experts already understand basic concepts, so one would focus on advanced use cases while when dealing with non-experts one would give foundational explanations before diving into complex topics.
